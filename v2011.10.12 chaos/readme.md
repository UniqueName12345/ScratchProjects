# Welcome to the Chaotic Beta Block Party!

## Important Note:
This project is like a time capsule - it only works with a very specific version of Scratch (v2011.10.12). So, if you’re planning to run it on a newer version, save yourself the headache and don’t even try.

## Description:
Feast your eyes on Sprite2 - the main attraction of this shindig. It's like a museum of beta blocks, showcasing all the quirky and cool ones that Scratch has retired over the years. Sprite1 is the designated hype-man of this party, constantly reminding you of how weird Sprite2's collection is. It's like having your own personal MC!

## Credits:
A big round of applause goes to the one and only ME for making this project happen. And a small shoutout to jellyfishfisher56 on Scratch for helping me find this obscure version of Scratch - I owe you one! 

So come on in, grab a drink, and let's get chaotic with beta blocks!
